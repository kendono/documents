## Difficult Key: X

The difficult key's behaviors vary, depending on the implementations.

Officially, there is no assigned character for the single key input of it.

To type character '難', the key input is one of followings:

- TOOG(廿人人土)
- TIOG(廿戈人土)

However, it most cases, we can directly get the key glyph with just a single key input. It might feels odd to type some combination, while we have in just right on the key glyph.

Some keyboards might support the single key input of X to type '難'. But, if it follows the strict rule, it might refuse to type any character.

Also, in case of traditional characters, there are not many cases which the input starts 'X'. In most cases, the input starts with non-X key, taking any part of the target glyph. Then after that, 'X' sometimes be used to describe the unusual glyph, which can't be decomposed easily.

If the input starts with X, the characters are mostly simplified Chinese characters. However, in many cases, there is no implementation for simplified Chinese characters. Because most Cangjie users are the ones who try to type traditional Chinese characters.

Partially, it would be possible to type Japanese Shinjitai characters. But mostly, the main target is traditional characters, especially for Cantonese speakers, which does not use Mandarin's pinyin, bopomofo keyboard, or any Japanese keyboard. Thus it's quite hard to work as an international keyboard which covers any countries or languages which use Han characters partially or entirely.

Also, Cangjie is mostly focused on Hong Kong region. So, even if it's Cantonese, the characters might not be enough if the area is not Hong Kong. While Macau is close to Hong Kong, the Guangdong region of China is quite far from Hong Kong, and even the language is also quite different, even the languages are all categorized as Cantonese.

## Special Key: Z

I said the X key has quite varying behaviors depending on the implementations, but still, it was a part of key combinations.

However, the key Z is not even the part of the key input combinations. The feature of Z key 'really' depends on the implementations.

But there are some patterns. And it's sorted like desktop and mobile.

- Desktop: Special symbol key
	- Z key can be used to type some Asian symbols, which are hard to be found in Western keyboards.
	- In these cases, the Z key's glyph is '重' in many cases. Originally, they glyph means 'a collision', in this case. It was for resolving character collisions, which have same key combinations. But it can be resolved with pressing numbers.
	- So the key is generally being used for creating special symbols.
- Mobile: Wildcard key
	- In desktop, the wildcard key is 'Shift + 8', which generates the asterisk(\*). However, for mobile, it might feels weird to do that.
	- Also, instead of typing some combinations, mobile keyboards can easily switch the keyboard layout to type the special symbols.
	- So, for mobile, it might be better to use Z key as the wildcard key. In this case, the glyph can be something like '通', which means wildcard, in this case.

## Trad. & Simp. Conversion

Depending on the settings, it is possible to generate Simp. characters with typing Trad. key inputs. Converting to Trad. from Simp. might be also possible, but it would be rare cases.

## Quick Cangjie

Traditional cangjie input requires 5 key inputs at the maximum. This can be bothering, if the user is writing some sentences.

In that case, the one might consider using Quick Cangjie.

Quick Cangjie only requires first and last input. Of course, there can be tons of collisions.

But, with recommendations, some common characters might be found quickly. And if it continues, it also would be possible to write a sentence with using only Quick Cangjie.

Also it's relatively easier to remember the necessary key inputs, since they are only 2 inputs.

## Studying with Decomposing

Even if you are not going to use Cangjie Input Method, the input key information still can be helpful.

Instead of a just radical, the Cangjie Key Input data helps you imagine the way of decomposing the glyphs.

The input is not based on any language's readings. So you can focus on remembering shapes first, planning remembering the readings later.

## Good Usage: Name

It can be hard to remember or combinations to make a meaningful sentence. And in most cases, the common daily-life words will be possible to be replaced by reading-based conversion, like Pinyin, Bopomofo, or Japanese keyboards.

However, the Cangjie Input is especially good to cover uncommon cases. And the representative case is the name.

If it's a name, it might contains super rare glyphs or super rare readings. Also, you might not even know how to read it. In that case, Cangjie Input can be helpful. The name won't change much. It would stay still.

Then, you can just remember the sequences of the typings. You might be able to take a note then copy and paste it, but it would be more convenient if you remember the Cangjie Input sequences of it.
